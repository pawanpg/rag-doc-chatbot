Lack of knowledge and perpetual disobedience of traffic rules have made our roads extremely unsafe. It does not come as a surprise that most of the drivers of motor vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and even the traffic police personnel managing and controlling traffic on the roads are not fully aware of the traffic rulesand driving regulations .Lack of awareness of the basic concepts of safe or defensive driving coupled with poor enforcement of rules of the road have resulted in chaotic driving conditions on Indian roads. More than 1,50,000 persons die in accidents on Indian roads every year. Thesituation on the road safety front will notimprove unless the prospective drivers are imparted proper training. One of the most important steps to bring some discipline on the roads and prevent accidents is to offer quality driver training and implement an effective licensing system. It was in this context that Haryana police prepared first edition of this Driving Manual in the year 2012. It filled a much needed vacuum and was extensively used in the model Learner Licence issuing Centers in several districts of the state for thetraining of the licence applicants. However, several amendments have taken place in the legal framework since then. Therefore, a need was felt to update the Driving manual. I am glad that the Transport Department has come forward and taken the initiative of updating theDriving Manual. The result is this second edition. It is a matter ofpersonal pride for me that I have been invo lved, rather than led the effort, in the preparation of both the editions. I believe that this driving manual will help to improve people's driving skills and it also proves to be extremely useful in reforming the licencing system in the state.

Rather, it is a privilege and this privilege comes with many responsibilities. In order to enjoy the privilege of driving, it is important that you should know what laws, rules and regulations exist for safe driving and must follow them at all times. As the driver of a vehicle, your aim should be to make driving a s afe and enjoyable experience for yourself, for the passengers in your vehicle, as well as for other drivers sharing the road. Driving is a complex task and complicated situations can arise at any point of time. How you react to such situations depends upon your training, alertness and your attitude while driving. 1.1.Purpose of the Driving Manual This driving manual has been prepared to help new drivers grasp the principles of safe and responsible driving. We have tried to present traffic rules and regulations along with examples and diagrams to create awareness among drivers and vehicle owners. Please bear in mind that this manual should be used only as a guide an d not as a substitute forthe existing traffic laws and statutes. If you are applying for a licence , this manual will help you prepare for Haryana State’s preliminary test and the driving test. If you already have alicence , the information contained in this manual will still be useful to improve your understanding of the rules of the road. Please note that the information provided in this document is subject to change on account of amendments in laws, statutes, rules and road signs. 5 2.THE DRIVING LICEN CE As per Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, an effective driving license is required to drive any motor vehicle on public roads.

Check the silencers regularly for any leaks. 19 3.7.Tyres The tyres should be kept properly inflated and in sound working condition. Inspect them regularly for cuts, cracks, uneven wear, bald spots, bulges, and punctures. Also, carry a good spare tyre and check its pressure periodically. 3.8.Windscreen and Windows The front windscreen of every motor vehicle must be made of laminated safety glass and the side windows and the rear window must be made of safety glass. These types of glasses prevent pieces from flying in the event of cracking or breaking of the window glass. Ensure that your view through the windscreen and rear window (through the inside rear-view mirror) is not obstructed by cracks, dirt, steam,water, ice or other objects placed or suspended between the driver a nd the windscreen. In addition, as per Rule 100(2) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, theglass of the windscreen and the rear window of every motor vehicle must be maintained such that the visual transmission of light (VTL) is not less than70%. For the side windows, the visual transmission of light must not beless than 50%. The Hon’ble Supreme court has banned the use of ablack film of any kind and of any VTL percentage on the windscreens or on the side windows of the vehicles and made the same an offence. 3.9.Windscreen andWiper Every motor vehicle other than a motor cycle or an invalid carriage ,having a windscreen, must be fitted with a power -operated windscreen wiping system. Regularly maintain the wipers in good condition for proper wiping offwater from the windscreen while driving in rain. 3.10.Direction Indicators and Stop Lights Every motor vehicle must be fitted with amber coloured, electrically operated blinking lights to indicate the driver’s intent to turn to the right or to the left. The lights must be fitted on the right and left sides of the vehicle and must be clearly visible from both front and rear. All motor vehicles other than motorcycles must be fitted with red coloured 20 stop lamps both on the rear left and right side of the vehicle. These lamps must light up when the foot -operated service brake is used indicating the intention to slow down or stop. Motorcycles must be fitted with one such stop light in the rear. Also, every motor vehicle must be fitted with at least one lamp in the rear that gets automatically operated throwing white light in the rear, when the vehicle is being driven in the reverse gear. In addition, all vehicles other than motor cycles, must be equipped with a device to make all the directional indicators flash together when the vehicle is stationary or immobilized on the road giving hazard warning to other vehicles."}

In addition, all vehicles other than motor cycles, must be equipped with a device to make all the directional indicators flash together when the vehicle is stationary or immobilized on the road giving hazard warning to other vehicles. Check regularly to ensure that these lamps are in working condition. 3.11.Reflectors Every motor vehicle other than motorcycles and three -wheelers must be fitted with two red reflectors, one each on both sides at the rear. Motorcycles must be fitted with at least one red reflex reflector at the rear. Three -wheeled vehicles including e -rickshaw and e -cart shall be affixed at the front with a white reflecti ve tape and at the rear with a red reflective tape running across the width of the body and the tapes affixed at the front and rear shall be not less than 20mm width and shall conform to the requirement of relevant standards. In order to better understand the requirement of reflectors, it is desirable to know various categories of goods & passenger vehicles as under: Category M:Means a motor vehicle with at least four wheels used for the carriage of passengers and their lugga ge. •Category M -1: Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of passengers and their luggage and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat. •Category M -2: Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of passengers and their luggage and comprising nine or more seats in addition to the driver's seat and having a maximum mass not exceeding 5 tonnes. •Category M -3: Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of passengers and their luggage and comprising nine or more seats in addition to the driver's seat and having a maximum mass exceeding 5 tonnes. 21 Category N: Means a motor vehicle with at least four wheels used for thecarriage of goods. • Category N -1:Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass not exceeding 3.5 tonnes. •Category N -2:Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass exceeding 3.5 tonnes but not exceeding 12 tonnes. •Category N -3:Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass exceeding 12 tonnes.

Both the tapes must be running across the entire width of the vehicle body. •Trailers and semi -trailers falling in category N -2 and N -3 with gross vehicle weight over 7.5 tonnes ,manufactured on or after April 1, 2009, must be affixed with reflective contour markings at the four corners in the rear and both sides. The side markings must be at least 50 mm thick and must be of yellow colour whereas the rear markings must be at least 50 mm thick and of red colour. A whitereflective tape of at least 30mm thickness must also be affixed in thefront of the vehicle (Diagram 10). Diagram 10 •All the vehicles of categories M -2 and M -3, manufactured on or after October 1,2009, must be affixed with reflective tapes of at least 50mm thickness with white tape in the front and red tape in the rear. The tapes must run across the entire width of the vehicle body . Moreover, all the vehicles in theM-3 category must be affixed with a yellow 22 reflective tape of 50 mm thickness, running across the entire length of the vehicle body. 3.12.Head Lamps andRear Lamps Every motor vehicle must be fitted with headlamps and rear lamps that can be used to illuminate the road in front as well as in the rear. Thehead lamps must be illuminated half an hour after sunset or in situations when there is no sufficient light. The head lamps must clearly render objects, vehicles and persons visible at a d istance of one hundred andfifty- fivemeters ahead on the road. Moreover, the head lamps must be fitted with a mechanism to deflect light downwards (low beam ordipped light) so that the light does not dazzle any person or other drivers. It is a good and safe practice to use low -beam (dipped) headlights while driving in the city or other populated areas where the roads are generally lit with street lights. High beams are recommended in those areas where there are no streetlights on the road and the overall traffic is sparse. If you are travelling on a highway and using high -beam headlights, switch to low -beam headlights for an oncoming vehicle. Also,switch to low -beam headlights when you are behind another vehicle. Keep your headlights clean and get them adjusted regularly so that they aim properly. 3.13.Parking Lights Every motor vehicle other than amotorcycle or three -wheeled invalid carriage must be fitted with one white or amber parking light on each sidein the front, and two red parking lights one on each side in the rear of thevehicle. These front and rear parking lights remain lit when the vehic le is kept stationary on the road. 3.14.Use of Red, White, Blue Lights or Spotlights The use of blue light, red light, flashing light, and strobe lamps are restricted by law for vehicles that serve aspecific purpose. No motor vehicle"}

No motor vehicle must show ared light to the front and no light other than red inthe rear of the vehicle except for white light to illuminate the registration mark, a white lightused while reversing the vehicle, or amber coloured directional indicator lights. 23 Use of red, blue, white or flashing lights is restricted to: •Ablinker type red light with purple glass for ambulances, •Ablue light with flasher as determined and notified by the State Government, •Ared light with or without a flasher on the vehicles carrying high dignitaries as notified by the Central or State Government. •Ablue light with or without flasher on vehicles escorting high dignitaries, •Multi-coloured red, blue, or white lights on vehicles used for emergency purposes as notified by the State Government, •Light on vehicles used by the officers of the police department, •Bluelights on fire tenders, fire trucks, or other emergency vehicles. Furthermore, vehicles cannot carry a spot light or search light on the front except in exceptional conditions as approved by the registering authority. 3.15. Rear-view Mirror As per Rule 123 of the Haryana Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993, every motor vehicle other than a road -roller, must be fitted, either internally or externally, with a rear -view mirror so placed as to enable the driver of the vehicle to see or become aware of any other vehicle in the rear. It is recommended to use aday/night type of inside rear -view mirror that hastwomodes of operation . The ‘night’ mode reduces the glare from the headlight of the following vehicles reflected in the rear -view mirror during night driving. Most of the newer motor vehicles come with side -view mirrors, one on each side to assist the driver in getting the side views of the road on both sides of the vehicle. It is a good practice to make use of the side -view mirrors (also called wing mirrors) on both sides of the vehicle rather than keeping them folded. Keep the mirrors clean and without any cracks for a proper view around the vehicle. Adjust your rear -view mirrors before starting off, and know your blind spots. 24 3.16. Seatbelts and Airbags Aseatbeltis an important device thatcan prevent injury or death incase of an accident. For the vehicles fitted with seatbelts, it is mandatory, a s per the Central Motor vehicles rules, 1989, for the driver of thevehicle and the person seated in the front seat to wear seat belts at all times while the vehicle is inmotion . In addition, in thecase of theM1 category of passenger vehicle (i.e.,vehicles having acapacity of 8 or fewer seats other than the driver), persons occupying a front -facing rear seat are also required to wear seat belts at all times while the vehicle is moving. Seat belts are for your own safety. Your chances of surviving a motor vehicle accident improve significantly if you wear a seat belt."}

Seat belts are for your own safety. Your chances of surviving a motor vehicle accident improve significantly if you wear a seat belt. • • •The seatbelt keeps you behind the wheel and in control of the vehicle in caseof a collision. The seatbelt keeps your head and body from hitting the inside of thevehicle. The seatbelt keeps you inside the vehicle in a collision. A person who isthrown out of the vehicle during the collision has a higher chance of getting aserious injury. It is very important to wear the seatbelts properly. Always put theshoulder strap over your shoulder, never under your arm. The lap belt should be put low over the hips, not over the stomach . Airbags are supplemental devices to help prevent serious bodily injury or death. You must wear a seatbelt even if your vehicle is equipped with airbags. Airbags are helpful in preventing injury only when a seat beltisworn. Infact, if you are not wearing a seatbelt, airbags can cause bodily injury. 3.17. Pollution Control Every motor vehicle must carry a “Pollution Under Control” certificate which is valid for six months and 12 months for the vehicles manufactured as per BS-IV or BS -VI norms (Rule 115 CMVR). The new motor vehicles must be re - certified for“Pollution Under Control” after the expiry of one year from the date of first registration. The certificate must always be carried in the vehicle atall times. Maintaining your vehicle in good condition, and following some good driving practices not only helps reduce air pollution but also saves fuel costs. •Keep your engine properly tuned, and tyres properly inflated. 25 •Observe road signs and traffic laws. •Avoid speeding. •Avoid frequent acceleration and braking. •Remove access weight and avoid keeping heavy items in your vehicles. •Use car -pooling, public transport, bike or walking wherever possible. •Plan or combine errands into a single trip. •Turn off the ignition at long traffic stops or other long hold -ups. 3.18. What Must NOT be on My Vehicle? •Any red or blue lights showing to the front, flashing or blinking lights, •Any spot lights or search -lights, •Any multi -toned horn or siren that gives a succession of different sounds, •make use of a cut -out by which exhaust gases are released other thenthrough the silencer, •Tinted glass windows in violation of Rule 100(2) of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, •Black film on windows, •Vehicle painted olive -green which is reserved for vehicle of adefence department or painted yellow with dark blue lines which arereserved for the vehicles of educational institutions carrying students, and •Motorcycles i n yellow colour, which is reserved for the police department. 3.19. Check Your Vehicle Quickly check your vehicle daily before you begin driving for the following: •Windscreen and windows for any cracks. •Windscreen wipers are in good condition. 26 •Look for proof of water or oil under the vehicle that might indicate a leak. •Check for wear and tear of tyres and proper tyre pressure. •Make sure the gauges are"}

It is also a good practice to regularly do the following, especially before going on a long trip: •Check that the battery is in good condition and the connections are proper. •Check that the engine oil, engine coolant, brake oil and windscreen wiper fluid levels are above the minimum level as specified. •Check that the lights including headlights (high beam and dipped beam) and stop/brake lights are working properly. •Check for any leaks in the exhaust system. •Keep a spare tyre that is in good condition. •Keep a first aid kit, a flashlight, tools needed to replace a tyre and if possible, a portable fire extinguisher. 27 4.TRAFFIC SIGNS, SIGNALS AND ROAD MARKINGS Traffic signs, signals and markings on the roads and pavements are meant to provide clear guidance to help the drivers drive safely, regulate traffic, cautioning the drivers of dangers ahead, and informing the drivers offacilities available en -route. They convey a clear, visual and precise meaning in a simple form. Every prospective driver, therefore, must know all road signs, signals and markings found on the public roads and highways and follow them at all times. 4.1-Signs Road signs are published by Indian Road Congress (IRC) and usesymbols and pictures. These are uniformly followed across the country.They are shape and color - coded to give you a quick idea about what the sign says even before you are close enough to read it. Road signs are of three types: •Mandatory Signs •Cautionary Signs •Informatory Signs Mandatory Signs These signs are mandatory and must be followed at all times. Mandatory signs are circular, except the ‘Stop’ sign and the ‘Give Way’ sign. Mandatory signs are reproduced below for your quick reference. STOP SIGN This sign is used on roads where traffic is required to stop before entering a major road or intersection. GIVE WAY SIGN You must give way to the other traffic having the right-of-way. NO ENTRY This sign is located at places where the entry of all vehicles isprohibited. 28 STRAIGHT PROHIBITED OR NO ENTRY Thissignis located at places where the vehicles are not allowed to enter or go straight. ONE WAY SIGN Vehicles prohibited in one direction. This indicates that traffic going forward is prohibited. ONE WAY SIGN Vehicles prohibited in one direction .Thisindicates that traffic going in the other direction is prohibited.

Arrows control the flow of traffic in the direction of the arrow. 36 Red If you see red light as shown in diagram 11, come to a complete stop before entering the intersection and before the stop line, or pedestrian or zebra crossing, if any. You must wait until thered light turns green. A red arrow means no turning in the direction of the arrow. Diagram 11 Amber If you see amber light as shown in diagram 12, before you enter the intersection, stop your vehicle behind the stop line or crosswalk (pedestrian crossing). If you have already entered the intersection and the light turns amber, continue moving on, but with caution . A yellow arrow means proceed with caution in the direction of the arrow. Diagram 12 Green Green light as shown in diagram 13 means you continue moving through the intersection carefully giving way to the pedestrians and other vehicles already in the intersection. A green arrow indicates that you may proceed in the direction of the arrow if you are in the proper lane. Diagram 13 Flashing Signals Flashing red signal as shown in diagram 14 means you must come to a complete stop behind the stop line or pedestrian crossing, and move through the intersection only when it is safe to do so .Flashing amber signal warns drivers to Diagram 14 slow down and drive with caution. Pedestrian Crossing signals These signals help pedestrians cross the roadsafely. As a pedestrian, you can cross the road if you face a green ‘walk’ sign as shown in diagram 15. Diagram 15 Never try to \"beat the light.\" If the light turns yellow and you have enough space to stop safely, please stop. 37 4.3-Traffic Police Hand Signals If the traffic is being controlled and directed by the traffic police personnel, follow their hand signals even if they are different from traffic lights or signals as there may be an emergency situation on the road. Thefollowing pictures illustrate different hand signals used by the traffic police as shown in the diagrams from 16 to 21.

They help guide and control the flow of traffic, and promote road safety. It is very important for the drivers to understand road markings and follow them. Below are some of the important road markings as shown in diagrams from 22 to 41 that you will occasionally come across.

Below are some of the important road markings as shown in diagrams from 22 to 41 that you will occasionally come across. Diagram 22 Single Broken Line Central line marking with broken white line separates two opposing streams of traffic. It is permitted to cross to the other side of a single broken line for overtaking when it is safe to do so. It is note worthy that the central line -markings are longer than the lane line -markings. These are 3 meters long,whereas broken line markings dividing lanes are shorter in length. Single Solid Line Diagram 23 A solid central line indicates that it is not allowed to cross to the other side for overtaking except for entry or exit from a side road or a premise or to avoid a stationary obstruction. The solid centre line is normally white in colour but can optionally be yellow also. 39 Double Solid Line Diagram 24 Double solid central line indicates that it is not allowed to cross to the other side for overtaking except in emergency situations. Combination of Broken and Solid lines Diagram 25 If the line on your side is broken, you may cross or straddle it for overtaking if it is safe to do so. If the line on your side is solid, you must not cross or straddle it. This road marking is usually used where the visibility ahead is less due to a curve or the landscape. Parking is prohibited on these stretches of the road. Parking is also prohibited where a yellow line is marked on the edge of the road. Stop Line Diagram 26 40 Stop line with ‘STOP’ word marked on the road as shown in diagram 26 indicates where you are required to stop before an intersection and give way to vehicles on the major road you are approaching. You should proceed only after ensuring that it is safe to d o so. Where a pedestrian crossing is provided, the stop line is marked before the pedestrian crossing. Give Way Line Diagram 27 The give way line is usually a double dotted line marked transversely at junctions. These lines are generally supplemented by a reverse triangle ‘give way’ sign painted on the road surface before the dotted lines or by a road sign installed beside the marking. Give way line indicates that you should give way to traffic on the main approaching road. Zebra Crossing Diagram 28 Zebra crossing is a succession of alternate black and white stripes painted parallel to the road. These are provided for the pedestrians to safely cross the road . Pedestrians have the right of way at these crossings.

BASICS OF DRIVING As a driver of a motor vehicle, it is important to have agood understanding of certain concepts and aspects of driving in order to be able to drive safely. 5.1 Qualities of a Good Driver Driving requires good hand -eye coordination and quick reflexes. Three important traits of a good driver are - Anticipation: Be aware of traffic around you and what are the signals or tendencies of your fellow drivers. It is easy to anticipate that a child or a toddler is likely to run across a road without any indication. Plan ahead for the unexpected. Concentration: Keep your focus on the road and actively scan for possible obstructions. The driver should be well -rested, calm and not under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at any time. Positive Attitude: Positive attitude is very essential while driving. Be a responsible driver. Show"}

Positive Attitude: Positive attitude is very essential while driving. Be a responsible driver. Show courtesy to other road users. Aggressive driving is not conducive to safe and responsible driving. Stay calm in all situations. Give space to an aggressive driver rather than competing with him or getting angry. 5.2 Driving Checklist Before Boarding Your Vehicle •Wear comfortable clothes while driving. It is advisable to wear shoes while driving,instead of slippers or chappals, to have aproper grip on the footpedals. •Do not drive if you are not feeling well mentally or physically or are feeling tired and sleepy. •Do not drive if you have taken medicine that can affect your ability to safely control or drive a vehicle, or have consumed alcoholic beverages. Drunken driving is an offence under section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which is punishable up to six months of imprisonments or fine of rupees ten thousand, or both, in the first instance. •Walk around your vehicle for any sign of problems like a flat tyre, oil leak, open trunk etc. Boarding Your Vehicle •Know the inside of your vehicle to get comfortable with controls and other features. •Check that your view is not hampered due to dirty windscreen or scratches there on. 46 •Adjust your rear -view mirror and side mirrors for a good view of the surroundings. •Check that you can comfortably reach the foot pedals .Push the clutch pedal on the far left down to the floor. You should be able to do this without stretching. If needed, adjust your seat and steering wheel that will help you maintain a comfortable posture. •Put on the seat belt and request all the passengers to do the same. It is required by law that even the passengers sitting on the front -facing rear seats of the car should wear seat belts if provided. •Make sure that all the doors are properly locked, and •before you start the engine, check that the handbrake is on and the gear lever is in aneutral position for a manual transmission vehicle. Forautomatic transmission vehicle, the gear lever must be in ‘P’ or ‘N’positions. Starting Your Vehicle and Moving off •Check for any warning or alerts on the car’s dashboard. Normally, these warning signs go off once the engine starts. •Use the proper turn signal, if needed, to merge into the traffic. •Check for pedestrians, cyclists or other vehicles before merging into the traffic and merge only when it is safe to do so. 5.3 Guiding Rules of Safe Driving This section explains some important rules of safe driving. Following Distance It is a good and safe driving practice to maintain a reasonable following distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you. This gives you enough space to slow down or change your pathsafely, in case the vehicle in front applies brakes o r slows down. Traffic, speed, weather conditions, visibility can impact the safe following distance between vehicles. As a"}

Following Distance It is a good and safe driving practice to maintain a reasonable following distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you. This gives you enough space to slow down or change your pathsafely, in case the vehicle in front applies brakes o r slows down. Traffic, speed, weather conditions, visibility can impact the safe following distance between vehicles. As a rule of thumb, use the ‘2 second rule’ in normal conditions (see Diagram 42). Diagram -42 Two Seconds Rule means that you should keep the following distance from the vehicle in front of you such that it takes your vehicle to reach the vehicle in the front at least 2 seconds assuming that the front vehicle is stationary. To me asure the following distance, pick a fixed object like a signpost, telephone pole, a bridge or a tree ahead of you and the vehicle you are following. As the vehicle in front of you passes that object, begin to 47 count seconds by saying ‘one -thousand -one, one -thousand -two, one - thousand -three’ and so on until your vehicle reaches that object. If you reach the object before you have counted one -thousand -two, it means that your following distance is too less to be safe; slow down and try the above steps again until you are at a safe following distance. You should further increase the safe following distance during adverse weather conditions likerain, fog, snow or during thenight. Tyre and tarmac rule When stopped behind another vehicle, maintain distance in such a way that you can see the road under the rear wheels of the vehicle in the front as shown in diagram 43. This translates into a distance of 4 -5 feet from the vehicle in front. This space will allow you to move around the vehicle or will give you some cushion of time of react ing(for example, to blow the horn) if the other vehicle is parked uphill andaccidentally rolls back. Similarly, this stopping distance gives the mtime to react to the driver of thevehicle Parked down hillinfront ofyour vehicle, if your vehicle accidentally rolls forward while parked. Diagram 43 Diagram 45 Diagram 44 The third advantage of following the Tyre and Tarmac rule is that in case of a traffic jam, drivers get space to move their vehicles to one side for giving passage to emergency vehicles. Diagram 46 Important tip: If you can see the headlights of the vehicle stopped behind you, it means its stopping distance from your vehicle is correct. 48 MSM Rule MSM rule is one of the most important rules of safe driving. This rule applies to most actions of a driver, viz. moving off, changing lanes, taking a turn, overtaking or pulling up. MSM stands for Mirrors, Signal and Manoeuvre. Use of Mirrors is the first phase of the MSM rule. It is important to regularly scan road swith the inside rear -view mirror and the side mirrors on the left and right side sof the vehicle. This helps to create a mental picture of what is on the road around you. Actively observe the traffic in the mirrors well before you plan to change your pos itionon the road or direction to have an idea about"}

This rule applies to most actions of a driver, viz. moving off, changing lanes, taking a turn, overtaking or pulling up. MSM stands for Mirrors, Signal and Manoeuvre. Use of Mirrors is the first phase of the MSM rule. It is important to regularly scan road swith the inside rear -view mirror and the side mirrors on the left and right side sof the vehicle. This helps to create a mental picture of what is on the road around you. Actively observe the traffic in the mirrors well before you plan to change your pos itionon the road or direction to have an idea about the position of other vehicles, their speed , and to know if any of the other vehicles have given any indication to change their position too. Look at the inside rear - view mirror first to have an idea about the traffic behind you before checking the side -mirrors for any vehicle on the side. It is important to know that the inside rear -view mirror is flat but the two side mirrors (wing mirrors) are convex. As a result, thevehicle at a distance appears small and gradually increases in size as they come closer. In other words, the vehicles and objects in themirror are actually closer than they appear. Signal to turn is the second phase of the MSM routine. Once you have checked the mirrors and the road looks clear to change your direction, give appropriate turn signal -by either usin g thevehicle’s turn indicator, or ahand signal, or both -to show your intent clearly to change direction toother road users. TheManoeuvre phase is when you actually take the action of changing thedirection. This phase can be further divided into the four sub -phases - Position, Speed, Look for blind spots and Act. ThePosition phase is used to bring the vehicle in a position from where thevehicle can be manoeuvred easily into the desired position. It is not always necessary to alter the position of the vehicle if you are already in a good position for the manoeuvre. Speed change is the next step after positioning the vehicle. Make sure that your speed is appropriate to carry out the manoeuvre, which, in some situations, may mean that you increase your speed, reduce it or even come to a complete stop. It may also be necessary to change the gears during this manoeuvre to maintain control of the vehicle. 49 Look for blind spots. This phase adds a final check to assess the situation to decide whether to go ahead with the manoeuvre or wait. Even though you keep looking ahead and assessing the situation throughout the entire MSM routine, thisis where a decision to proceed or wait has to be made. This is the time when you look over your shoulder to the side for any vehicles. This takes care of any blind spots which are not covered by your side mirror. Actto complete the manoeuvre . The example below illustrates the MSM therule for lane change manoeuvre from middle lane to the right most lane (faster lane): Diagram47 Mirrors The driver first checks the mirrors -inside the rear-viewmirror and the two wing mirrors to create a mental picture of the traffic around.

Diagram 49 50 Manoeuvre Position Position the vehicle for the manoeuvre. This step may not be needed if you are already in a good position. In this example, the driver moves the vehicle closer to the lane edge while still staying well within the lane. Speed This step is to adjust the speed and gear of your vehicle for a safe and smooth manoeuvre. In this example, the change of lane is to the right side which isusually a faster lane. The driver increases the speed of the vehicle to reach the speed of the moving traffic in the right -most lane. Note that vehicle speed needs to be increased only if it is safe to do so. The driver then maintains that speed and position until the manoeuvre is completed. Diagram 50 Look This is the final step before the change of lane manoeuvre is carried out. For a lane change to the right lane, the driver looks around and looks over his or her right shoulder to check the blind spot. This final check is needed to assess whether it is safe to carry out the manoeuvre Diagram 51 51 Act Once the driver decides that it is safe to change lane, he safely moves to the right lane completing the lane change manoeuvre. Diagram 52 Right-of-Way Right of way is a very important concept while sharing the road with other road users. It determines which vehicle gets to go first in different situations. It is the responsibility of the drivers and the pedestrians to obey this rule for thesmooth flow of traffic. This rule is based on courtesy and common sense. Here are some of the common situations described for understanding the right-of-way rule: •Emergency vehicles like ambulances, fire tenders, police vehicles with flashing lights always have the right -of-way in all conditions. •Zebra crossings belong to the pedestrians .Pedestrians have the right of way at the zebra crossings and at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. When entering an intersection or facing a zebra crossing, slow down and give way to any pedestrians crossing the road. •If you are about to enter the round about, the vehicles already in the circle have right of way. •Vehicles merging with the traffic after turning left using slip lanes must give way to any vehicle on the road. 52 •In case of a Stop sign, the driver must stop at the Stop line and if there is no Stop line, before entering the intersection, and give theright of way to vehicles already in the intersection. •If two vehicles reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the right has the right of way. •When turning right, give theright of way to the oncoming vehicles going straight or turning left. •If all the sides at an intersection do not have Stop sign or stop line, then the vehicles"}

Diagram 55 Vehicle Bwill give way to vehicle Aas vehicle Ais turning on the side road on the same side and vehicle Bis turning on the opposite side of the road.Diagram 54 Vehicle Acan merge with the traffic only when a safe gap appears in traffic on the main road. Diagram 56 Vehicle Aleaving the main road has the right of way over vehicle B wishing to join the main road. 54 Diagram 57 For turning right, vehicle Awill give way to oncoming traffic and will turn only when a safe gap appears in traffic. Diagram 59 5.4 Cutting CornersDiagram 58 Vehicle Bis joining the same side and Vehicle Ais joining the opposite side of the road. Vehicle Ahas to give way to vehicle B. In diagram 59, vehicle Ais turning right. Since it is merging with traffic on the opposite side, join only when a clear gap appears on both sides as shown. Cutting corners is a very common problem on Indian roads. Most drivers are not aware of the correct way of taking a right turn and indulge in cutting corners, posing a threat to their own safety as well as that of others. The correct method of turning right is to move your car straight and start turning when the dividing line of the side road meets your car approximately in the middle as shown in diagram 60 below. This will ensure that your vehicle on completing the turn will enter the correct lane on the side road. Any attempt to take turn sat an earlier point in time may r esult in acollision with avehicle coming from the side road. Correct turning also helps the approaching driver from the side road get a clear view of the vehicle turning right. 55 Diagram 60 Diagram 61 This rule also applies to the vehicles on the side road turning right for merging on the opposite side of the main road as shown below. The driver of Vehicle Ashould go straight until the front of his car reaches approximately middle of the road and then turn right. Failure to do so can lead to potential collision with the vehicle coming from the right.

Diagram 62 5.5 Courtesy on the Roads While the rules governing the right of way as described in the previous section apply in general, it is equally important for drivers on the main road to have the right of way to show courtesy and stop to allow the vehicles to merge with/leaving the main road to go first whenever the volume of traffic is high, otherwise ,the waiting time for the vehicles on the side road becomes agonizingly high. This is particularly true during rush hours. Failure to show such courtesy will lead to traffic Diagram 63 jam on the side road. Lack of courtesy on the road often leads to traffic jamsas shown in Diagram -63. 56 At any crossing whenever traffic lights become out of order, then it is a common picture as shown in thediagram 64. It happens only because of alack of courtesy. Courtesy also means leaving access to pedestrians on Zebra crossings arefree during traffic congestion. Similarly, at an intersection, even if the signal isDiagram 64 green but the road ahead of the intersection is not clear, a courteous driver stops before the intersection, leaving the junction box. Another common occurrence is on manned railway crossings where cars and two -wheelers often occupy the lanes meant for oncoming traffic causing traffic jam sas shown in Diagram -65. 5.6 Tips for Safe DrivingDiagram 65 Safe or defensive driving, as per the National Safety Council, USA, is getting to the destination safely -no traffic fines or tickets, no accidents, no harm or injury, with no hassle to the others on the road. In other words, it simply means driving responsibly and with common sense. Driving does not just mean getting your driving license. It also means imbibing good driving habits. Below are some of the important tips that will help you to be a safe and responsible driver. •Observe and obey traffic signs and signals all the time . That means no rolling stop. Stop completely at the stop line or when you see a stop sign. •Check mirrors and cover your blind spots by looking over the shoulder. Always be aware of the blind spot of other vehicles especially the big trucks. Stay out of other vehicle ’sblind spots. •Use turn signals appropriately while turning or changing lanes. •Stay alert and scan the road frequently for hazards. 57 •Do not drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or if you are feeling sleepy or drowsy. •Distracted driving is dangerous and illegal. No multi -tasking - texting, talking on the phone, eating, reading, watching a movie, adjusting radio/CD player/GPS, shaving, putting a makeup etc. - while driving. •Adjust driving speed to theroad, weather and other conditions. •No tailgating. Leave a safe following distance from the vehicle in the front. •Keep your vehicle in good condition. Keep windscreen, windows and mirrors clean and keep the tyres properly inflated. •Share the road with trucks, bikes, pedestrians, motorcycles and other users of the road. •Be courteous and do not drive aggressively. Driving is not"}

Keep windscreen, windows and mirrors clean and keep the tyres properly inflated. •Share the road with trucks, bikes, pedestrians, motorcycles and other users of the road. •Be courteous and do not drive aggressively. Driving is not a contest and it is not about ‘winning’. It is about reaching your destination safely. •Use seatbelts for all occupants of the vehicle. It is much safer for the children and kids to be in the rear seat of the vehicle. •Keep a first -aid kit in the vehicle. •Watch for arough and uneven shoulder of the road which may be lower than the road. •Watch for animals and slow -moving vehicles. Slow down and cross them when it is safe to do so. •Give way to emergency vehicles and do not follow them. Move over tothe lane away from the emergency vehicle. If you cannot move over, slow down. •Wear helmets while riding a two -wheeler. •Be watchful while crossing unmanned railway tracks. Cross only at designated crossings and do not try to beat the train. Trains are generally travelling much faster than they seem to. •As a parent, it is your responsibility to make your kids, especially young adults, aware of safe driving. Encourage good driving 58 habits in them. It is but obvious that parents who do not follow safe driving practices have teens who follow their example. •After acertain age, physical and mental changes like vision changes, strength and flexibility, reaction times, can affect driving. Have your eyes checked regularly? Learn the effects of medication on your driving skills and vision. •Children need to be made aware of the dangers of playing in or around the vehicles or the dangers of climbing into a vehicle trunk (boot space). When a child is missing, make sure to check in the vehicles and their trunks quickly. •Do not leave children or pets alone in the vehicle any time, even when going for a quick errand. •Stop for pedestrians .Be alert for children, especially around schools, residential areas or school buses. 5.7 Turn Signals Other drivers expect you to go straight. Therefore, if you intend to slowdown , stop or turn, you must indicate. Give the other road usersample time to react to your move. You should use signals before you: •Change lanes, •Slow down or stop, •Turn at the intersection •Enter or exit a highway •Move away from the kerb to merge in the traffic when you start off. •Move to the side of the road or stop over to the side of the road. It is a good habit to signal whenever you change direction. Signal even when you do not see a vehicle. Signal as early as you can and when it isappropriate to do so but do not start signaling too early. You should indicate your intention to turn only when yours is the next available turn. During daylight hours when the visibility is normal, you may use hand 59 andarm signals in addition to, or instead of, using your vehicle’s electrical turn indicators. You may not use hand signals at night or in situations"}

You may not use hand signals at night or in situations where your hand signals may not be visible to others. Diagrams from 66 to 70 illustrate the hand signals that may be used by the drivers to indicate their intentions: Diagram 66 Diagram 67 Diagram 68 Turn Right Turn Left Stopping Diagram 69 Diagram 70 Slowing Down Car Following the Other Car can Overtake 5.8 Speed Speeding is a major factor in many motor vehicle accidents. You must obey the speed limits as specified on the roads or highways. Driving faster than the posted speed limit on the road or highway is illegal. As a general rule ,you must not drive at a speed faster than it is safe and reasonable under existing conditions on the road .Your safe speed depends upon: •Road conditions -curves, narrow bridges, wet and slippery conditions, loose gravel, bumpy roads mean driving at reduced speed. •Visibility -darkness, rain, fog, smog, snow, intersections, hills, curves can result in low visibility and call for reduced speed. •Traffic -Heavy Road traffic means added dangers. •Traffic Speed -Safe speed in a traffic condition is the average speed at which the other traffic is moving provided that it is not more than the posted speed. Travelling faster or slower than other vehicles may increase the danger of an accident. •Vehicle Condition -Condition of a vehicle including the condition of tyres and braking system may also affect the control you may have on the vehicle. For an older vehicle, with worn -out tyres and aless than anefficient braking system, it is advisable to drive slowly. 60 •Your physical or mental condition -Your mental and physical condition may also adversely affect your alertness while driving resulting in less control ofthe vehicle. The faster your speed is, thelesser the time that you may have to react andalso requires alonger distance to stop or slow down. Travelling at faster speeds increases the likelihood of accidents. And when an accident occurs at excessive sp eeds, the injuries also tend to be more serious. Speed Limit The speed limit is the maximum speed at which you can drive a vehicle under ideal condition s. If the conditions are less than ideal, you must slow down to a safe speed thatis less than the speed limit. Section 112 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 stipulates that ‘no person shall drive a motor vehicle or cause or allow a motor vehicle to be driven in any public place at a speed exceeding the maximum speed or below the minimum spe ed fixed for the vehicle under the Act or by any other law for the time being in force.’ Your speed must not be more than 25 km/ h, if you are passing procession, troops or police on the march or when passing workmen engaged in road repair work. 61 The following table lists the specifi cspeed limits for different categories of vehicles: No cognizance of the violation of"}

Many road accidents can be prevented by simply obeying traffic rules and by extending simple courtesy to other drivers. Remember that the public roads and highways must be shared with other drivers and users of the road. This section has been derived from the“Motor Vehicles ( Driving) Regulations, 2017” which serve as the basic guide for rules that have to be followed while driving on the road. It deals with basic facts such as a right of way,overtaking, turns, parking etc. 6.1. Keeping Left In India, vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road. It is important to keep to the left and let the traffic coming from the opposite direction pass on your right. Keep to your left as much as possible to avoid a head -on collision. When driving on a channelized road marked with lanes, drive within the lane, and stay close to the left of the lane. 6.2. Changing Lanes Changing lanes can be dangerous and must be done with caution. Follow MSM rule to change lanes. Make sur e you have safe clearance to the side, behind or ahead before moving to another lane. Never change lanesat intersections. Blind Spots are areas around your vehicle where your view is obstructed as shown in diagrams 71 & 72. These areas are not visible in the rear - view and side -view mirrors. Any pedestrian, vehicles or other objects in the blind spots may not be visible toyou. It is important to know your blind spots. Quickly look over your shoulder to the side of the turn for vehicles or pedestrians in the blind spots before you turn or change lane. Also, avoid driving into other drivers ’ blind spots.

Turning Turning improperly or without adequate indication may result in a traffic accident. Move safely to the proper lane well ahead of your turn. Always follow theMSM rule while changing to the turn lane and while making a turn. Turn only when it is safe to do so. While turning left, look for the merging traffic from the right side. Look for oncoming traffic while turning right. Finish the turn in the proper lane. If you need to move to anotherlane, do so only after completing you rturn and then change the lanefollowing the MSM rule. If the intersection is controlled by the traffic lights or by the traffic police personnel turn only when your lane is given the proper signal to turn (see Diagrams from 71 to 84). Correct Way to Turn Diagram 73 Left Turn : If the lanes are not marked with turn arrows, then move to the left -most lane well aheadoftime after checking the traffic behind you and signaling your intent. Use left turn indication to let other users of the road know about your intention to turn left. Cautiously turn into the left -most lane next to the kerb when it is safe to do so.

Diagram 81 Proper Right Turn: Enter the intersection straight around aquarter of the way before turning the wheels to the right for a turn. Make a sharp and quick turn.Diagram 80 Wrong Multilane Right Turn: Do not jump lanes or turn in to the wrong lane. Stay in your lane to avoid any accidents. Diagram 82 Wrong Right Turn: Do not start your turn before you enter the intersection. Never cross the central dividing line. This results in the vehicle staying in the line of the oncoming traffic for much longer. It also blocks the traffic trying to turn left. 66 Diagram 83 Correct Way to Overtake aVehicle That is Indicating to Turn Right: Proper way to overtake a stationary vehicle that is intending to turn right is, from the left side. Indicate to move to the left lane for overtaking using MSM rule. 6.4. OvertakingDiagram 84 Wrong Way to Overtake aVehicle That is Indicating to Turn Right : You must not overtake a vehicle on the right if that vehicle is waiting to turn right. Overtaking another vehicle requires caution. Overtake only when it is asafe to do so. Before overtaking, make sure there is safe distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead. Change lanes by following the MSM rule. Always overtake on the right unless the vehicle to be overtaken is indicating to turn right. If you need to overtake the vehicle ahead on a single lane road, do so only if it is permitted and there is a safe distance between you and the oncoming traffic . Immediately return to your side of thetraffic after overtaking. Do not overtake: •Ifovertaking is prohibited, •When you are near the intersection or in the intersection, •Ona curve when you cannot clearly see the road ahead, •Inthe tunnel or near or on the railway crossing, •When on coming vehicles aretoo close for safe overtaking. If you arebeing overtaken by another vehicle, you should help the driver who is overtaking you by reducing your speed and keeping to the left of the lane or road. 67 6.5.

If you arebeing overtaken by another vehicle, you should help the driver who is overtaking you by reducing your speed and keeping to the left of the lane or road. 67 6.5. Roundabouts A round about is a circle at a T -junction or an intersection that requires the vehicles to travel in one direction, clock wise, around a central is land as shown in diagram 85. Vehicles entering theroundabout must give way to all other traffic and pedestrians. It is very important to follow theMSM rulewhile entering and exiting the roundabout . Basic rules to negotiat ing aroundabout safely and effectively are as under: Diagram 85 1.Always move in a clock wise direction. 2.Always give way to traffic on your right. 3.Give thecorrect indicator. 4.Follow theMSM rule while entering and exiting the roundabout. Left Turn As indicated by the red vehicle in the picture above: 1.Signal left and approach in the left -most lane. 2.Give way to any traffic already in the roundabout. Pedestrians have the right -of-way at the crossings. 68 3.If it is safe to enter the roundabout, cautiously move forward in the left most lane. Continue signaling for the left turn. 4.Keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signaling left to leave in the left -most lane. Go Straight The yellow vehicle in the above picture shows the proper way to go straight at the roundabout. 1.Select the appropriate lane on approach to and on the roundabout. If no marking on the road it is usually safest to keep to the right lane. 2.Approach without signaling as you have to go straight. 3.Give way to any traffic already in the roundabout. Pedestrians have the right -of-way at the crossings. 4.Keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundab out. 5.Signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want, and exit safely. Right/U Turn The blue vehicle in the above picture shows the proper way to make a right turn at the roundabout. 1.Signal right and approach in the right -hand lane. 2.Enter cautiously giving right -of-way to pedestrians and other vehicles already in the roundabout. 3.Keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout. 4.Signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want, and exit safely. A similar strategy can be used to make a U -turn. In this case, the vehicle continues to go around the central island (roundabout) with theright turnsignal blinking and then signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want to take. 69 6.6. U-Turn A U-turn is a 180 -degree turn that reverses the direction of your vehicle. You should not make a U -turn where it is specifically prohibited or unless it is safe and you can do so without disrupting the traffic. 6.7. Reversing Reversing or backing up a vehicle can be tricky and requires good practice and control. Before reversing, it is advisable to walk around your vehicle to make sure nothing is behind it.

Reversing Reversing or backing up a vehicle can be tricky and requires good practice and control. Before reversing, it is advisable to walk around your vehicle to make sure nothing is behind it. Look to the front, sides, and rear. Continue to look out of the rear window of your vehicle while reversing. While reversing out of your drive -way to the public road, reverse into the nearest lane slowly and cautiously. Reversing your vehicle is not allowed on highways unless you are instructed to do so by the traffic p olice personnel. Your aim while reversing your vehicle must be to ensure: •Thesafety of others behind your car, •Youhave the vehicle under control, •Youmake proper use of the accelerator, clutch, brakes and steering , •Youreverse without brushing any other vehicle or pedestrian, and •Youare aware of other road users. 6.8. Stopping Indicate your intention to stop to other drivers before you stop or slow down, and do not brake suddenly. Even when thedriver is alert and the road and vehicle conditions are ideal, it takes some distance to bring a vehicle to a complete stop. You can prevent crashing into another vehicle with good judgment and understanding of stopping distances. To bring a vehicle to stop: •You need to see the danger or the need to stop, •You must press the brake paddle to stop the vehicle. Time taken to perform the above steps is called the reaction time, which may further be affecte d by the road or weather conditions. The distance a vehicle travels during the reaction time is called the reaction distance. Once you apply brakes, the friction between tyres and the road comes 70 into play to slow down and finally stop the vehicle. The vehicle may travel some distance before it comes to a complete stop. This is called the braking distance. Braking distance depends upon the condition of the road and tyres, tyre pressure, vehicle weight, and the effectiveness of the braking system. The total stopping distance is the sum of the reaction distance and the braking distance: Stopping distance = Reaction distance + Braking distance For example, a vehicle travelling at 50 km/h will tak e around 11 metres to react using an average reaction time of three -fourth of a second (0.75 secs)for a normal, attentive driver. Thebraking distance for a vehicle running at 50 Km/h is around 14 metres. Therefore, Stopping distance = 11 + 14 = 25 metres. A vehicle travelling at ahigher speed will cover asubstantially longer distance before coming to a stop. The following diagram gives a good ideaofhowmuch distance is needed to stop a vehicle at different speeds on a dry level pavement.

If you need to stop or leave your vehicle on a major road, move them away from the main travelled portion of the road on to the shoulder. Use emergency lights, parking lights, or low -beam headlights especially during nights when parking on the highways to alert other drivers. Always apply the parking/hand brakes after parking the vehicle. Before moving from the parking position, a lways check for traffic, and indicate your intention with proper use of signals. DO NOT leave children and pets unattended in the parked vehicle. Parallel parking This type of parking means parking vehicles in a line from front to rear.This is usually on the left edge of the road. Following steps as shown in diagrams from 86 to 90 can be used for parallel parking of your vehicle: 72 Diagram 86 Diagram 87 Diagram 88 Diagram 89 Diagram 90 Step 1 : Stop parallel to the car parked ahead in such a way that rear wheels of both vehicles are in the same line.Step 2 : Turn the steering wheel by 360 ˚ in anti-clock wise direction and backup slowly until your left wing mirror is in line with the rear end of the car ahead.Step 3 : Turn the steering wheels by 360 ˚ in the clockwise direction. This will straighten your wheels. Now backup slowly, until you see your rear door handle touching the kerb in the left -wing mirror.Step 4 : Now turn the steering wheel by 360˚in the clock wise direction and backup slowly until your car is parallel to the kerb.Step5:Turn your steering wheel to the left by 360 ˚ to straighten your wheels and move forward to position your vehicle in the middle. To exit from the parallel parking position, •Back up slowly and cautiously to avoid hitting the vehicle in therear, •Follow the MSM rule to check for any traffic coming from behind in the rear-view mirror, indicate your intention to come out of theparking by showing the right indicator, look over the shoulder tocover the blind spots, •Turn the wheels to the right sharply and slowly move forward. Angular Parking In this case, the vehicles are parked at an angle to the kerb of the road as shown in diagram 91. The following steps can be used for angular parking: Diagram 91 1.Look for the traffic in the mirrors, and over the shoulder. 2.Flash left indicator to signal that you intend to park the vehicle. 3.Steer into the parking space and straighten the wheels. 4.Apply the handbrakes, and shift into the first gear.

To exit from the angular parking, look through the mirrors, and over the shoulder, and slowly reverse the vehicle if the road is clear. Take extra care for cyclists, rickshaws or pedestrians. 73 Perpendicular Parking In this case, the vehicle is part at the right angle to the road. You reverse park your vehicle so that it is easy to exit as shown in diagrams from 90 to 92. Diagram 92 Step1: Gotothe car next to theparking spot as shownabove. The distance between your vehicle and the parked vehicles must be at least5-6 feet. The rear of your vehicle must have crossed the second line of yourparkingspot.Diagram 93 Step 2: Turnthesteering to theleft completely, change to reverse gear and slowly reverse your vehicle into the parking spot. Watch out for people, cyclists, and other vehicles.Diagram 94 Step 3: Once your vehicle is parallel tothe parked vehicles, straighten out the steering and continue reversing until you have parked properly. To exit from perpendicular parking: 1.Indicate your intention to turn left or right by giving proper turn signal. 2.Look out for through traffic, pedestrians, cyclists, and slowly and cautiously move ahead until your vehicle is almost out of Parking. 3.Turn your steering wheel in the direction you want to turn continuing to keep the turn signal blinking while steering your vehicle in the proper direction. Parking on A Slope While parking on a slope, you must ensure to apply parking brakes. Also, move the steering wheel of your vehicle to point the front wheels as indicated in the diagrams from 93 to 95 given below. This ensures that in case the parking brakes disengage and the vehicle rolls down the hill, it gets stopped by the kerb if present. If the kerb is not present, the vehicle rolls away from the road. 74 Diagram 95 Diagram 96 Diagram 97 6.10. Emergency Situations on the Road There is always a chance for some kind of unexpected emergency no matter how cautious you are driving or how well -maintained your vehicle is. This section discusses some of the common situations and some tips to handle them should they arise. You are advised to call for assistance in case of any emergency. Brake failure If you see a warning light about the brake problems, get them checked immediately at the authorized service centre. If you experience brake failure while driving, pump the brake pedals hard many times. This may build up enough brake pressure to stop the vehicle. If it does not work, slowly apply parking brakes to avoid skidding. If the conditions of the road allow you to slowly come to a stop, shift your vehicle into a lower gear and continue to do so as your vehicle slows down. Cautiously move the vehicle towards the edge of the road on your side, and pull over and stop. Wait for help and do not drive the vehicle to the nearest garage.

Cautiously move the vehicle towards the edge of the road on your side, and pull over and stop. Wait for help and do not drive the vehicle to the nearest garage. Steering Failure Steering failure occurs when your vehicle stops responding to your turning of the steering wheel. If you experience a steering failure, slow down . Do not brake unless it is necessary to avoid an accident. If you must apply the brakes, do so slowly. Sudden application of brakes may throw the vehicle out of control. You may also experience the stiffening of the power steering wheel if the engine dies. Try to start the vehicle quickly while continuing to drive (by pressing the clutch pedal and turning the key to start the vehicle for example). In case the vehicle does not start, you may have to stop the 75 vehicle. In case your vehicle has power brakes, you may have to press the brakes hard to stop the vehicle. Blowouts ABlowout is a burst tyre that can throw your vehicle out of control. If youexperience a blowout, hold the steering wheel tightly, steer the vehicle straight ahead, and slowly release the accelerator pedal. Do not brake suddenly and only brake when the vehi cle is under your control. Pullthevehicle completely off the road or highway cautiously watching out for other traffic. Vehicle Approaching Your Lane If you see a vehicle travelling towards you in your lane, slow down immediately by braking and move out of the oncoming vehicle’s path towards the left edge. Avoid moving to the right side to avoid a collision as the other drive rmay try to return to the correct lane and will be in your path again. If the vehicle contin ues to move towards you, steer off the road to the left to avoid a crash or head -on collision. Blow horn or flash headlights to alert the driver in case he or she may be sleepy or distracted. Running Off the Road If your vehicle drifts off the road and on to the shoulder, do not try to swerve back onto the road immediately. Stay on the shoulder and slow down by releas ingthe accelerator pedal. After you have reduced the speed go back on the road when it is safe to do so and then speed up. Headlight failure If your headlights suddenly go out or stop working, try the headlight switch a few times or use the dimmer switch. If that does not help, try using parking lights or hazard warning lights as one of them may work and may provide you with enough light to warn other vehicle sand guide youtosteer yourvehicle off the road. The sudden opening of the hood If the hood of your vehicle suddenly opens while you are driving, slow down immediately by taking your foot off the accelerator and try to look under the hood to see the road ahead.

If that does not help, put your head out of the window safely to look around the hood. You can use the lane markings as a guide. Steer your ve hicle to the side of the road and stop. Stuck Accelerator Pedal If your vehicle’s accelerator pedal gets stuck, you may be able to free it by hooking your toe/foot under the pedal and pushing it up to free it. Keep an eye on the road while trying to free the pedal. If it does not help, 76 apply the brakes and shift the gear to neutral. Choose a safe path and steer your vehicle to the edge of the road. Use warning/hazard lights to warn other drivers. Vehicle stuck on railway Tracks If your vehicle gets stuck on the railway tracks and a train is approaching, you and your passengers must leave the vehicle immediately. Move away quickly from the railway tracks to a safe place in the direction from which the train is approaching to avoid being stuck by the debris from the collision. Do not try to stay on the tracks to remove your belongings from the vehicle. Slippery, Flooded o r Wet Road Roads can become slippery when wet during rains, snow or ice. Driving on such roads at high speeds can be dangerous and can cause the vehicle to lose traction. If you come across such a situation while driving, gradually take your foot off the accelerator to slow down the vehicle. Braking suddenly on a wet or slippery road can make the vehicle go out of control. Tightly hold your steering wheel and try to keep the vehicle go straight ahead. Sudden and excessive turning of the steering wheel can also result in the vehicle going out of balance. Fire or Overheating If you see fire or smoke coming out of the vehicle, immediately steer the vehicle off the road, and stop. Turn off theignition andget all the passengers away from the vehicle immediately. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle to avoid getting injured in case of asudden burst of flames or explosion. Do not use water to put out the fire as that may actually spread the blaze. If you have afire extinguisher, use it on the flames by opening the hood only enough to direct it on the fire. If the fire is strong or if opening the hood might be dangerous, stand back and call for help. In case there is an indication of engine overheating, switch off any unnecessary vehicle equipment like air conditioning. Pull over to the side of the road, stop the vehicle and turn the engine off immediately. Raise thehood if it is safe to do so to allow the engine to cool down. Do not open the radiator cap.

Plunging Under Water Most vehicles with windows and doors closed will float on the su rface for a few seconds and may stay afloat for a couple of minutes. Make every effort to come out of the vehicle immediately. Use open windows to exit 77 before the water reaches the level of the windows. If the vehicle becomes submerged, the doors may not open until the pressure inside the vehicle and outside is equal. You may be able to open the doors once the vehicle is completely filled with water and there is no structural damage to the vehicle. The vehicle usually sinks nose-first due to the weight of the engine in the front. The air pocket in the rear passenger compartment provides you with some breathing time while you plan for an exit strategy. You may have to move to the rear to exit. If there are other passengers in the vehicle try to exit the vehicle together. Avoiding a Collision There are times when it looks that a collision may happen. There are mainly thefollowing options available to the driver to avoid a collision. Brakes are the instinctive choice to slow down the vehicle and to bring it to stop quickly. However, if the vehicle is not equipped with anti -lock braking systems, sudden and hard braking can result in a skid. If the vehicle starts to skid, release the brake pedal, then push it down again. Evasive Steering can also be used to go around the object or vehicle to avoid acollision. It is important to consider the traffic and the movement ofthe vehicle you are avoiding. Accelerating quickly is another manoeuvre that maybe necessary attimes to avoid collision when you are about to be hit from behind or from the side. For vehicles with manual transmissions, shift to the lower gear to accelerate quickly. Protecting Yourself and Your Passengers in Collisions There are times when you are not able to avoid a collision even after you try everything you can to avoid a collision. Your seatbelt is your best protection against serious injury or death in a colli sion. Here are some guidelines that will help you in situations if you cannot avoid a collision. Hit from the behind. If you are about to be hit from behind, •Be ready to apply the brakes so that you will not be pushed into another vehicle in the front. •Brace yourself between the steering wheel and theback of the seat. •Press your head firmly against the head restraint to avoid sudden jerks to your neck. 78 Hit from the side. If you are about to be hit from the side, •Try to take the hit, if it is at all possible, on the side or the area of the vehicle away from you and other passengers in the car. •Brace yourself firmly with the steering wheel to prevent youfrom being thrown against the side of the vehicle. •Get ready to steer quickly to control the vehicle in case your vehicle goes into a spin when hit.

However, if your vehicle is not equipped with airbags, •Use your hands and arms to protect your face. •Throw yourself across the seat, to avoid getting hit by the steering column or the windshield. 79 7.HAZARDOUS DRIVING CONDITIONS This chapter highlights some good driving practices that can be followed while driving in hazardous conditions. 7.1. Weather Conditions Driving in difficult weather conditions like rain, snow, or fog presents its own hazards and requires extra driving skills. Such weather conditions can considerably reduce your ability to see the road, vehicles, and the surroundings. Fog during wi nter times can reduce visibility drastically as shown in diagram 98. The best rule during foggy conditions is toavoid driving. If you must drive, you should: Diagram 98 • • • • • •Lower your speed greatly according to the visibility . Turn the headlights on. Use dipped lights (low beam) to prevent glare. Never drive with only your fog lights on. Use left edge markings on the road to guide you. It is advisable to use emergency blinking lights if needed. If you are following a vehicle increase the distance between the vehicle in front of you. Use your windscreen wipers and defroster, if needed, for the bestvision. Rain can reduce your visibility. Slow down at the first sign of rain. Use windscreen wipers, dipped headlights (low beam) and defroster. Rain and wet conditions can also turn the road slippery reducing the grip of your vehicle’s tyres on the road. This can result in a condition called ‘aquaplaning’ or ‘hydroplaning’ as shown in diagram 99. Aquaplaning, resulting from a combination of road conditions, water, and speed, makes the tyres glide on athin layer of water losing all contact withthe road. This means there is no friction when braking, accelerating, or turning andcan result in skidding of the vehicle.Diagram 99 To prevent aquaplaning, reduce the speed of the vehicle when it starts raining, or you see standing water or puddle. Maintain proper tyre pressure and replace tyres when they become worn or lo ose treads. 80 Snow, ice or sleet makes the roads wet and slippery. On slippery road s, the key to driving is slowing down, braking or turning gently, and maintaining an increased distance from the vehicles in front of you. Clear any snow and ice from your vehicle before driving, and use a defroster. Watch out for shaded areas or under bridges as the ice melts slowly at such places. Keep your vehicle’s ventilation system in good condition, and check for any leaks in the exhaust system to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. You may need to use chains while driving during heavy snowfall. It is a good practice to carry blankets with you, in case you get stuck in heavy snow. 7.2."}

You may need to use chains while driving during heavy snowfall. It is a good practice to carry blankets with you, in case you get stuck in heavy snow. 7.2. Driving in Hills Driving in a mountainous or hilly region can be quitea challenge. Slow down when you come to a hill or acurve. Do not overtake another vehicle when a curve or hill is blocking your view as you Cannot see far enough ahead to know if it is safe to overtake. Keep your vehicle to the left as the roads are usually narrow . You may use the horn , ifit is not prohibited, to warn other drivers. Also, keep an eye for falling rocks in landslide -prone zones especially during Diagram 100 or after rains. 7.3. Night Driving Driving at night is a bigger challenge than many people may think. When driving at night, your ability to see ahead, and the ability of the other road users to see you, is reduced due to low visibility, glare, and fatigue. Make sure your vehicle lights are working properly. Clean your windscreen and rear window and ensure that they are free of defects. Use headlights at sunset, atnight, or whenever there is no tsufficient light on the road. It is advisable to reduce the speed of the vehicle at night as the visibility is reduced. Use dipped lights (low beam) well before you see an oncoming vehicle or if you are following another vehicle to avoid dazzling other drivers with your headlights. Glare from the oncoming vehicles, as well as the bright headlight reflected from the rear -view mirror ,can reduce your vision or may even blind you momentarily as shown in diagrams 101 & 102. To reduce the glare from oncoming vehicles, shift your eyes to the lower left side of the road, and 81 concentrate on the left side markings on the road. To cut the glare from the rear, adjust your rear-view mirror. Diagram 101 Diagram 102 Fatigue is another reason behind theincreased chances of a motor accident happening. Driving at night either after a long and tiring day or after driving for a long time can make you drowsy. Always try to be well -rested before you start your trip. To reduce fatigue, you should: • • • • • • •Stop as often as you need. Come out of the vehicle and walk around to stretch and get some fresh air. Let someone else drive, or take turns driving. Have a cup of coffee or asoft drink. Chew gum or eat candy Ask passengers to talk to you. Listen to the radio. If all this does not help, it is better to stop at a safe place (roadside restaurant, motel, petrol station etc), turn off the engine, lock the doors, open the windows slightly for ventilation and sleep for a while. 82 8.DRIVING OFFENSES AND PENALTIES The aim of enforcing traffic laws, rules and regulations areto enhance road safety and reduce road accidents.
